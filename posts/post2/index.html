          <p>I guess you would much prefer if the title was &ldquo;Why are some people bad ?&rdquo;, this is because we often see questions such as &ldquo;Why are some people evil ?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>We are far more likely to question ourselves &ldquo;Am i a bad person ?&rdquo; rather than &ldquo;Am i a good person ?&rdquo;. Humans give more attention to bad things, and this might be a natural defense mechanism, it&rsquo;s like the brain tries to anticipate bad scenarios to keep you alerted n' help you survive.</p>
<p>But what if we ask ourselves&hellip;&ldquo;Why are certain people good ?&rdquo;&hellip;What if the opposite of the popular question is the answer to it&hellip;What makes a person a good one ?&hellip; I&rsquo;m gonna try to answer based on my analysis of the personnalities of many persons (friends, family, colleagues, strangers&hellip;). Again this is not a scientific or a proof based answer, this is purely based on my personal observations, and recognizing different patterns of peoples&rsquo;s personnalities, and you are free to disagree.</p>
<p>Someone is a good person because he <strong>IS</strong> a good person, he didn&rsquo;t choose to be one, he just <strong>IS</strong> a good one, it&rsquo;s the same way a psycopath or a pedophile is what he is, no one chose to become a pedophile&hellip;you just are one. One doesn&rsquo;t get to choose to be a good person, sure you could &ldquo;try&rdquo; to be one, you could set a high model of a good person and look up to him and try to be like him, that&rsquo;s what everyone who thrives to be a good person does but if you are a bad person, that&rsquo;s like a birth mark that needs alot of work to be removed and controlled because you are subconsciously bad.</p>
<p>Now the question is, okay fine&hellip; We are what we are&hellip;Why ?&hellip;How ?&hellip; What makes we &ldquo;we&rdquo; ? There must be a a defining factor in who we are, and why we act like we do&hellip;</p>
<p>The early ages of a child are the crucial times in defining or shaping a person&rsquo;s personnality and behaviour, a person becomes good or bad at a very early age, this due to multiple factors but they all boil down to two major ones: genetics and environment, those two are the most important ones in defining the behavior of a person, we can tell if a person is good or bad by evaluating and analyzing those two factors.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s sad about this, is that as a kid we have no control over these two defining factors, for example a bully in school, didn&rsquo;t choose to become one, it&rsquo;s his environment that lead him into becoming one, such as an abusive father beating him or his wife&hellip;This is why, i have far more respect for people that try to do good inspite of their bad behaviors; when one recongnizes he&rsquo;s always doing bad actions in certain situations and tries to overcome that, that alone, is a great act of self love and respect, and for all of you doing good things, I respect you alot.</p>
<p>Bad people are the ones that get the spotlight sadly, and this is because bad people have a noticeably larger effect than the good ones, it only takes one bad person to have a huge effect, but it takes ten or more good persons to have a one.</p>
<p>In a capitalist society that rewards the bad, try to be good.</p>
