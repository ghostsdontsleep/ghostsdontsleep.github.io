          <p>&ldquo;Can you stop looking at me with that weird face of yours?&rdquo; asked the owl. Shocking Hades with its ability to speak human language. He dropped his head in disappointment, unable to comprehend what he had just witnessed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; the owl continued. &ldquo;I get anxious when someone stares at me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re not a ghost&hellip;&rdquo; said Hades in a sad tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What? What do you mean I&rsquo;m not a ghost? Of course, I&rsquo;m not&hellip; What the actual fuck&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hades, even more disappointed, turned around and began walking towards his home. &ldquo;Hey! Wait! Kid! Come back&hellip; Oh my god, do I really have to do it again?!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owl flew out of the tree and went straight to the kid with his claws wide open, in a fast speed. As he got close to Hades, he slowed down and landed gently on Hade&rsquo;s shoulder. When the contact occured, the earth started spinning at a speed faster than the speed of light. Ultimately, thousands of years passed by in seconds. At 7 seconds, the end of the universe was reached. The large amount of matter and radiation worked to pull everything back together. The Universe expanded to some maximum size, and the expansion reversed to contraction&hellip; The Universe recollapsed in a Big Crunch.</p>
<p>On Saturday, January 21st, 2023, at 10 pm, Hades decided to go out as usual to the garden of his house. In the garden, he spotted a weirdly shaped object sitting atop a tree branch. He took a step forward to find out what this object was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why does it always tire me&hellip;&rdquo; whispered the owl. &ldquo;&hellip;What a selfish, pathetic piece of fur I am&hellip; Just say hi to the kid&hellip; there&rsquo;s nothing to get anxious about&hellip; Oh Hi little kid!&hellip; &ldquo;Remember, he&rsquo;s gonna ask me about being a ghost&hellip;&rdquo; mumbled the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re an owl, you&rsquo;re not a ghost&hellip;&rdquo; said Hades in a disappointed tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You like ghosts?&rdquo; said the owl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes..&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because they don&rsquo;t sleep&hellip;&rdquo; responded Hades.</p>
<p>A brief moment of silence occurred because the owl seemed pretty confused. &ldquo;Hey, do you have any friends?&rdquo; the owl asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes..&rdquo; responded Hades.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you like them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I do. They&rsquo;re my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; Inquired the owl</p>
<p>&ldquo;They said it&hellip; They said they&rsquo;re my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another brief moment of silence occurred. Hades lifted his eyes at the owl, as if he was about to say something&hellip;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I find solace in sleep,&rdquo; said the owl softly, &ldquo;for in those moments I can escape the chaos of the world and slip into oblivion. But when I wake, the disappointments of reality are like a heavy weight on my heart, reminding me of all the troubles and worries that I had left behind in my dreams.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s boring&hellip;&rdquo; responded Hades.</p>
<p>The owl smiled at how innocent Hades was. &ldquo;Hey, how&rsquo;s your parents? Do you like them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hades dropped his head to the ground in pure sadness, and after a moment of silence, he said, &ldquo;No&hellip; I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The owl was extremely surprised, as he had anticipated the answer to be positive.</p>
