          <p>In a late chill night, Hades decided to go out for a walk in the neighborhood, a middle-class type of neighborhood where most neighbors work normal 9 to 5 jobs and seemed to possess little empathy or compassion.</p>
<p>Hades is 10 years old. He has medium-sized black hair and big hazel eyes. He wears a long-sleeved white shirt with blue stripes, a long red scarf around his neck, a pair of black summer shorts reaching slightly above his knees, a pair of brown slippers with some white socks. The most eye-catching element of Hades&rsquo;s outfit is a dark blue captain&rsquo;s hat with a white brim, which sits atop his head at a jaunty angle.</p>
<p>Born from a father who only comes at night to sleep after spending the whole day out gambling on horses, and a mother who daydreams all day about having a better husband, Hades likes his own company. He likes venturing out and discovering things by himself, such as searching for new insects, plants, and animals.</p>
<p>Around 10 PM, Hades left home to go to his favorite spot, the house&rsquo;s garden. He likes it more than his room and toys. There&rsquo;s nothing special about the garden, just a simple normal-sized garden with a single tree, enclosed by wooden fences. No swimming pool, no swing, no doghouse, nothing fancy&hellip;</p>
<p>As he stepped into the garden, he felt as if he was transported to a different world. The garden stretched out before him, inviting him to wander and explore. The sweet scent of the flowers all over him, as if welcoming him back to a place he had long forgotten. He closed his eyes and let himself get lost in the moment, feeling as though he was floating through space, weightless and free.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a peculiar sound caught his attention, one that he had never heard before. As he opened his eyes, he noticed an unfamiliar object standing atop a tree branch. He approached it with a mixture of curiosity, wonder, and concern, he was amazed to discover that the object was, in fact, a living creature, an <strong>animal!</strong> Its round, oversized eyes and curved, pointy nose were wrapped by soft, beautiful grey feathers&hellip;It is in fact an owl.</p>
<p>The kid and the owl locked eyes, and in that moment, it was as if nothing else existed in the universe&hellip;</p>
