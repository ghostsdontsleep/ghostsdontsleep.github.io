          <p>Hi, my name&rsquo;s Adnane, and I&rsquo;m a 22-year-old data engineer. I&rsquo;m passionate about music, learning new languages, and computers (those are the ones I can think of&hellip;). Favorite food? Noodles. Favorite show? Mindhunter. Favorite website? Reddit!!!</p>
<p>I know this is the internet, and one should be cautious about what information he provides about himself, right? Well, no actually, the internet has already enough information about you (besides your darkest deepest secrets).</p>
<p>A logical rule of thumb is that everyone should protect himself here or at least not share intimate stuffs non-anonymously. But what if you just do it, just share it, break the rules, be wild, throw your thoughts into this big ocean we call the &ldquo;Internet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I came to the realization that a better place for my ideas and thoughts is here on the internet instead of my head. Where they can be seen, liked and disliked by everyone, it&rsquo;s an unbelievable way to express yourself to the world.</p>
<p>But what does this make me ?&hellip;A social media influencer? An attention seeker? I don&rsquo;t know, and I don&rsquo;t see why I should have a reason for doing anything honestly. As long as it&rsquo;s moral then just do it and enjoy the process; it&rsquo;s what we call <em>Life</em>.</p>
<p>So, this is an answer(?) to some of you who are wondering why I&rsquo;m doing all of this.</p>
<p><em>Ghosts don&rsquo;t sleep, so you know that i&rsquo;m alive.</em></p>
