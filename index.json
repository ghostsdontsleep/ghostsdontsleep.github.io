[{"content":"I guess you would much prefer if the title was \u0026ldquo;Why are some people bad ?\u0026rdquo;, this is because we often see questions such as \u0026ldquo;Why are some people evil ?\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are far more likely to question ourselves \u0026ldquo;Am i a bad person ?\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;Am i a good person ?\u0026rdquo;. Humans give more attention to bad things, and this might be a natural defense mechanism, it\u0026rsquo;s like the brain tries to anticipate bad scenarios to keep you alerted n' help you survive.\nBut what if we ask ourselves\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;Why are certain people good ?\u0026rdquo;\u0026hellip;What if the opposite of the popular question is the answer to it\u0026hellip;What makes a person a good one ?\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m gonna try to answer based on my analysis of the personnalities of many persons (friends, family, colleagues, strangers\u0026hellip;). Again this is not a scientific or a proof based answer, this is purely based on my personal observations, and recognizing different patterns of peoples\u0026rsquo;s personnalities, and you are free to disagree.\nSomeone is a good person because he IS a good person, he didn\u0026rsquo;t choose to be one, he just IS a good one, it\u0026rsquo;s the same way a psycopath or a pedophile is what he is, no one chose to become a pedophile\u0026hellip;you just are one. One doesn\u0026rsquo;t get to choose to be a good person, sure you could \u0026ldquo;try\u0026rdquo; to be one, you could set a high model of a good person and look up to him and try to be like him, that\u0026rsquo;s what everyone who thrives to be a good person does but if you are a bad person, that\u0026rsquo;s like a birth mark that needs alot of work to be removed and controlled because you are subconsciously bad.\nNow the question is, okay fine\u0026hellip; We are what we are\u0026hellip;Why ?\u0026hellip;How ?\u0026hellip; What makes we \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rdquo; ? There must be a a defining factor in who we are, and why we act like we do\u0026hellip;\nThe early ages of a child are the crucial times in defining or shaping a person\u0026rsquo;s personnality and behaviour, a person becomes good or bad at a very early age, this due to multiple factors but they all boil down to two major ones: genetics and environment, those two are the most important ones in defining the behavior of a person, we can tell if a person is good or bad by evaluating and analyzing those two factors.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s sad about this, is that as a kid we have no control over these two defining factors, for example a bully in school, didn\u0026rsquo;t choose to become one, it\u0026rsquo;s his environment that lead him into becoming one, such as an abusive father beating him or his wife\u0026hellip;This is why, i have far more respect for people that try to do good inspite of their bad behaviors; when one recongnizes he\u0026rsquo;s always doing bad actions in certain situations and tries to overcome that, that alone, is a great act of self love and respect, and for all of you doing good things, I respect you alot.\nBad people are the ones that get the spotlight sadly, and this is because bad people have a noticeably larger effect than the good ones, it only takes one bad person to have a huge effect, but it takes ten or more good persons to have a one.\nIn a capitalist society that rewards the bad, try to be good.\n","date":"2023/03/17","image":"https://ghostsdontsleep.github.io/posts/post2/img2.jpg","permalink":"https://ghostsdontsleep.github.io/posts/post2/","summary":"I guess you would much prefer if the title was \u0026ldquo;Why are some people bad ?\u0026rdquo;, this is because we often see questions such as \u0026ldquo;Why are some people evil ?\u0026rdquo;.\nWe are far more likely to question ourselves \u0026ldquo;Am i a bad person ?\u0026rdquo; rather than \u0026ldquo;Am i a good person ?\u0026rdquo;.

But what if you just do it, just share it, break the rules, be wild, throw your thoughts into this big ocean we call the \u0026ldquo;Internet.\u0026rdquo;\nI came to the realization that a better place for my ideas and thoughts is here\u0026hellip;on the internet instead of\u0026hellip;my head.
